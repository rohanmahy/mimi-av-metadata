            Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) Content format
                     draft-mahy-mimi-av-metadata-00

Abstract

   The More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) content format is
   a container for rich content, which can reference image, video, and
   audio files.  This document describes metadata for these files to
   allow for more pleasant rendering.

1.  Introduction

   The MIMI content format [I-D.ietf-mimi-content] can convey a variety
   of media types, as either inline or referenced external content.  In
   messaging applications it is common to display audio, video, and
   static image content, collectively audio/video (AV).  The layout for
   messaging applications often reserves a placeholder for the AV
   content.  While it is common for static images to be immediately
   displayed, audio and video content is often not immediately
   downloaded and rendered.  Even if image data is downloaded
   immediately, if there is a network or server delay there can be time
   when the aspect ratio or dimensions of the image are not yet know.
   It is therefore useful to have some rendering hints about the media
   for more pleasant rendering.  This document defines extensions to the
   MIMI content format to provide these hints.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses a variety of terms from the MIMI content format
   definition, especially NestedPart, SinglePart, ExternalPart, and
   MultiPart.

3.  AV Metadata Extensions

   The AV Metadata MIMI content extension is an array of AV metadata
   entries.  Each AV metadata entry is a CBOR map of AV metadata
   properties, all of which are optional except the part_index and type.
   The semantics of the individual property fields is as follows:

   *  part_index: refers to the order of MIMI parts from the relevant
      part inside the NestedPart structure in a MIMI content message.
      It can refer to a SinglePart or ExternalPart.

   *  type: an integer enumeration representing the media type (not-
      including the subtype). audio is 1, image is 2, and video is 3.
      An extension socket is defined, although its need is not
      anticipated.

   *  width: the width of the image or video in pixels

   *  height: the height of the image or video in pixels

   *  duration: the duration of the audio or video in seconds.  It can
      be expressed as an unsigned integer or a positive floating point
      number

   *  preview_index: for a video part, the partIndex of another related
      part that represents its image preview.  It can refer to a
      SinglePart or ExternalPart, or a MultiPart with chooseOne
      partSemantics which contains only SinglePart or ExternalPart
      types, all of which must be an image with a disposition value of
      preview.

   *  accessibility_text: this text could be rendered instead of the
      audio, image, or video when various accessiblity settings are
      enabled, or during no or slow network access when a cached or
      preview image is not available.

   *  rotation: one of four values: 0, 90, 180, or 270.  This integer
      refers to the number of degrees of clockwise rotation (in 90
      degree increments) needed to correctly view the image.

      Note that an orientation field is not necessary.  Any image and
      video with a width field which is larger than its height is
      assumed to have a landscape mode orientation, while one with a
      height larger than its width is assumed to have a portrait mode
      orientation.

   The following snippet of Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)
   [RFC8160] is used to formally define the structure of the extension.

   av_metadata_array = (
       "av_metadata" : [ * metadata_entry ]
   )

   metadata_entry = {
       &(part_index: 1) : uint16,
       &(type: 2)       : audio / image / video / $ext_media,
       ? &(width: 3)              : uint,
       ? &(height: 4)             : uint,
       ? &(duration: 5)           : nonnegative_number,
       ? &(preview_index: 6)      : uint16,
       ? &(accessibility_text: 7) : tstr,
       ? &(rotation: 8)           : 0 / 90 / 180 / 270
       $ext_av_metadata
   }

   nonnegative_number = uint / float .gt 0.0
   uint16 = uint .size 2

   audio = 1
   image = 2
   video = 3

4.  Example

   Below is an example of a video of puppies, a preview image, and an
   audio clip.

   "av_metadata" : [
     {
        /partIndex /         1: 2,
        /type      /         2: 3, /video/
        /width     /         3: 1920,
        /height    /         4: 1080,
        /duration  /         5: 37, / in seconds. can be uint or float /
        /preview_index /     6: 4,
        /accessibility_text/ 7: "two golden retriever puppies playing in" +
                                "overgrown grass lit with low sunlight"
     },
     {
        /partIndex /         1: 4,
        /type      /         2: 2, /image/
        /width     /         3: 1920,
        /height    /         4: 1080
     },
     {
        /partIndex /         1: 7,
        /type      /         2: 1, /audio/
        /duration  /         5: 9.45, / in seconds. can be uint or float /
        /accessibility_text/ 7: "uproarious laughter"
     }
   ]
